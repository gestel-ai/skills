# Brand DNA Template

<!-- GESTEL local support doc for gestel-ads-photoshoot. Distilled from the -->
<!-- MIT-licensed claude-ads repo (commit 283d9d4917cb7c4f2ce9181e125bb1970f74ab04), -->
<!-- file ads/references/brand-dna-template.md. Self-contained; not a runtime dependency. -->
<!-- The schema and injection rules below are provider-neutral. References to specific -->
<!-- generation models are illustrative only; gestel-ads-photoshoot does not wire any -->
<!-- model up locally — it injects these fields into prompt text and routes generation out. -->

## Purpose

Defines the canonical schema for the optional `brand-profile.json` that
gestel-ads-photoshoot reads to inject brand DNA into photoshoot prompts. Use these
exact field names and value types so prompt injection is deterministic. The file is
optional: if it is absent, fall back to the standard style templates.

## Field Reference

### Voice Axes (1-10 scale)

Score interpretation: 1 = extreme left pole, 10 = extreme right pole, 5 = neutral.

| Field | 1 (Left) | 10 (Right) | Ad Implication |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------|
| `formal_casual` | Very formal, corporate | Very casual, conversational | Headlines tone |
| `rational_emotional` | Data-driven, logical | Emotionally evocative | Story vs stats |
| `playful_serious` | Fun, humorous | Serious, no-nonsense | CTA phrasing |
| `bold_subtle` | Big claims, loud | Understated, nuanced | Visual hierarchy |
| `traditional_innovative` | Classic, established | Cutting-edge, disruptive | Imagery style |
| `expert_accessible` | Deep expertise, jargon | Everyone can understand | Copy complexity |

`descriptors` (array of 3-5 strings): Free-form adjectives capturing tone not covered by axes.

### Colors

- `primary`: Main brand color. **Always inject into image generation prompts.**
- `secondary`: Supporting palette. Use for accents in generation prompts.
- `forbidden`: Colors to explicitly exclude from prompts (e.g., competitor brand colors).
- `background` / `text`: Digital UI colors (less relevant for ad image generation).

**Null handling:** If extraction fails for a color, set to `null`. Agents must skip null
color injection rather than defaulting to arbitrary colors.

### Typography

Used by `copy-writer` agent for tone calibration. Not injected into image prompts
(typography is handled by ad platform copy fields, not image generation).

### Imagery

- `style`: Main descriptor passed to image generation (e.g., "professional photography",
  "illustration", "flat design").
- `subjects`: Array injected as subject guidance in prompts.
- `composition`: Passed verbatim as a composition constraint.
- `forbidden`: Converted to negative prompt modifiers (e.g., "no corporate handshakes").

### Aesthetic

- `mood_keywords`: Injected directly into generation prompts as atmosphere descriptors.
- `texture`: Passed as texture preference.
- `negative_space`: "generous" → "plenty of white space, uncluttered composition".

### Screenshots (optional)

- `homepage`: Desktop screenshot of the homepage. **Primary visual style reference** —
  when a downstream generator supports image-reference / style-transfer, pass this as the
  brand style anchor. (Whether any such model is available is a provider-adapter concern,
  not something this skill assumes locally.)
- `secondary`: Additional pages (pricing, about, product). Supplemental context.
- **If field absent**: fall back to text-only prompt construction from the other fields.
- **If field present but file missing on disk**: note the gap and fall back gracefully.

## Extraction Guide

### Pages to scan (in order)

1. **Homepage**: Primary brand impression, dominant colors, hero headline tone
2. **About / Our Story**: Brand values, voice descriptors, team photography style
3. **Product / Service page**: Imagery style, composition, subject matter
4. **Existing ads** (if accessible via Meta Ad Library or Google Ads Transparency): Override

### CSS extraction targets

```text
background-color, color         → colors.primary / secondary
font-family                     → typography.heading_font / body_font
@import url (Google Fonts)      → typography (font name from URL path)
og:image meta tag               → imagery.style (analyze dominant visual)
```

### Voice scoring heuristics

| Signal | Scoring |
|--------|---------|
| Uses "you" and "your" frequently | formal_casual +2 (casual) |
| Industry jargon in hero text | expert_accessible -2 (expert) |
| Short sentences (≤10 words) | bold_subtle +1 (bold) |
| Testimonials lead with emotion | rational_emotional +2 (emotional) |
| "Trusted by 10,000+ companies" | traditional_innovative -1 (traditional) |

### Fallback heuristics

- **No Google Fonts detected**: Set `typography.heading_font` to "system-ui"
- **Sparse content (< 200 words)**: Mark `extracted_at` note: "low confidence extraction"
- **Dark mode site**: If background is dark (#333 or darker), swap `background` and `text`
- **Cannot extract primary color**: Use most prominent color from og:image analysis

## Usage in Generation Prompts

When building image generation prompts, inject brand DNA as:

```text
"[subject], [imagery.style], [imagery.composition],
brand colors [colors.primary] and [colors.secondary[0]],
[aesthetic.mood_keywords joined by comma] atmosphere,
[aesthetic.texture] texture, [aesthetic.negative_space] composition,
no [imagery.forbidden joined by comma]"
```

Example output:

```text
"person using laptop, professional photography, clean backgrounds good negative space,
brand colors #1A2E4A and #F4A623, trustworthy modern approachable atmosphere,
minimal flat texture, generous white space composition,
no stock photo clichés, no corporate handshakes"
```
